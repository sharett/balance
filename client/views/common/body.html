    <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

	<h3>What is balance?</h3>
	<p>Balance is an open-source tool to keep track of shared finances for groups.  Its respository is located
	on <a href="https://github.com/sharett/balance">Github</a>.</p>

	<h3>What do the different types of groups mean?</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Open:</strong> The group is visible to everyone, and anyone may join.</li>
	  <li><strong>Visible:</strong> The group is visible to everyone, and anyone may request to join,
		  but must be approved by a group coordinator.</li>
	  <li><strong>Invite only:</strong> The group is invisible except to members.  A group coordinator may
		  invite someone to join.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What are the types of transactions?</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Charge:</strong> A simple transaction between two members, where one member is charged
	  and the other credited.</li>
	  <li><strong>Payment:</strong> A record of a payment made by one member to another.</li>
	  <li><strong>Reimbursement:</strong> When one member has paid for something and needs to be reimbursed
	  by multiple other members, use this transaction type.  Designate who to reimburse and how much, and check
	  the checkboxes next to each member's name if they should be charged.  If the member who's being
	  reimbursed shares in the transaction, check their box too.  The system will evenly distribute
	  the charges, but you can modify them further if you wish.  All charges and credits must add up to zero.</li>
	  <li><strong>Other:</strong> The most flexible type.  Debit and credit any number of members, as long
	  as all charges and credits add up to zero.</li>
  </ul>
